# RNN-Generate-TV-Scripts
## Introduction
Welcome to this RNN project of the Udacity Deep Learning course. We generate an original TV script by using a recurrent neural network which has been trained on existing Seinfeld TV scripts. In other words, we are using a Seinfeld dataset of scripts for model learning. Have in mind, that the project iterates over a large amount of data, and it takes a number of hours to train, even on GPU.
